TO-DO List:
1) Lower London Hall size (and change its position accordingly) to be able to reduce camera.far parameter
2) Replace the urban background with a simple clear color
3) Limit OrbitControls to not move outside London Hall
// 4) Find out how to make simple objects (e.g a sphere) in a recurrent pattern (e.g up and down, left and right)
5) Change showFocus color in DoFFragmentShader to be only orange
6) Change all "var" in JS to "let" and "const"
// 7) Fix the GUI
8) Refactor index.js to avoid duplicated code
9) Implement compression to reduce 3D model loading times
10) Add loading splash screen while the 3D model is loading (like in the postprocessing library)
11) Update GLSL shaders to OpenGL ES 3.0
12) Find out how to host demo on Github
13) Fix antialiasing that does not work after resize
14) Remove useless uniform parameters from shader (e.g. blur shader)
